declaration:
  description: 'A fast-paced bluffing and deduction game where each player starts
    with 2 hidden influence cards and 2 coins. On their turn, players declare actions
    to gain coins, manipulate others, or eliminate opponentsâ€”some actions require
    specific characters, but players may bluff. Opponents can challenge claimed characters
    or counter-actions; incorrect bluffs cause the bluffer to lose an influence, while
    correct claims punish the challenger. Actions include Income (1 coin), Foreign
    Aid (2 coins, blockable by Duke), Coup (7 coins, force target to lose an influence,
    unblockable), Tax (Duke: gain 3 coins), Assassinate (Assassin: pay 3 coins to
    eliminate an influence), Exchange (Ambassador: swap with deck), and Steal (Captain:
    take 2 coins, blockable by Captain or Ambassador). Last player with at least one
    unrevealed influence wins.'
