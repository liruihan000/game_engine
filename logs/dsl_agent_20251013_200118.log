2025-10-13 20:01:45,036 [INFO] DSLAgent: Initial state: {'yaml_path': 'two-truths-and-a-lie.yaml', 'game_description': "A conversational party game where players take turns sharing three statements about themselves (two true, one false). Other players discuss and try to identify the lie through natural conversation and voting. Points awarded for correct guesses and successful deception.\\n\\nGame Flow Navigation: The game follows a speaker rotation system through phases - game_setup → round_start → statement_collection → discussion_phase → voting_phase → reveal_phase → scoring_update → (check if all players have been speaker) → round_start OR game_over. Each player takes one turn as the speaker per round. Multiple rounds can be played for longer games.\\n\\nConversation Mechanics: This game is purely conversational. Players share statements naturally like 'Here are my three things: First, I once met a celebrity. Second, I can speak four languages. Third, I've never broken a bone.' During discussion, players debate which seems false. Votes are extracted from conversation like 'I'm going with number two' or 'The language thing sounds made up.' No commands or structured inputs needed - the orchestrator interprets natural dialogue.\\n\\nWin Conditions: Game ends after all players have been speaker for the agreed number of rounds (default 1). Winner has highest total score from: correct lie identifications (1 point each) + fooling other players (1 point per player fooled when you're the speaker"}
