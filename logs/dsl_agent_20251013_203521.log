Each turn consists of drawing 2 cards and playing cards from hand.\\n\\nRole Victory Conditions: Sheriff wins if all Outlaws and Renegade eliminated. Outlaws win if Sheriff eliminated (even if they\'re dead). Deputies win if Sheriff wins. Renegade wins if they\'re the last player alive. Sheriff is always revealed, other roles stay hidden until eliminated.\\n\\nDistance and Range: Players sit in a circle. Distance = shortest path between players (clockwise or counter-clockwise). Base range for Bang! is 1 (adjacent players only). Weapons increase Bang! range. Some cards (Panic!, Cat Balou) have fixed range 1. Distance affects strategic positioning and alliances.\\n\\nCard Types: Playing cards include Bang! (attack), Missed! (defense), Beer (heal), Panic!/Cat Balou (steal/discard), Duel (force showdown), Indians!/Gatling (area attacks), Weapons (increase range), and other equipment. Each character has unique abilities that modify rules (e.g., Rose Doolan sees everyone at distance -1).\\n\\nReaction System: When attacked with Bang!, target can play Missed! to avoid damage. Indians! requires all players to discard Bang! or take damage. Duel creates Bang! exchanges until someone can\'t respond. Real-time reaction windows use collectInputs with timeouts."'}
