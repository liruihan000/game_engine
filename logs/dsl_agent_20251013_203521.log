Each turn consists of drawing 2 cards and playing cards from hand.\\n\\nRole Victory Conditions: Sheriff wins if all Outlaws and Renegade eliminated. Outlaws win if Sheriff eliminated (even if they\'re dead). Deputies win if Sheriff wins. Renegade wins if they\'re the last player alive. Sheriff is always revealed, other roles stay hidden until eliminated.\\n\\nDistance and Range: Players sit in a circle. Distance = shortest path between players (clockwise or counter-clockwise). Base range for Bang! is 1 (adjacent players only). Weapons increase Bang! range. Some cards (Panic!, Cat Balou) have fixed range 1. Distance affects strategic positioning and alliances.\\n\\nCard Types: Playing cards include Bang! (attack), Missed! (defense), Beer (heal), Panic!/Cat Balou (steal/discard), Duel (force showdown), Indians!/Gatling (area attacks), Weapons (increase range), and other equipment. Each character has unique abilities that modify rules (e.g., Rose Doolan sees everyone at distance -1).\\n\\nReaction System: When attacked with Bang!, target can play Missed! to avoid damage. Indians! requires all players to discard Bang! or take damage. Duel creates Bang! exchanges until someone can\'t respond. Real-time reaction windows use collectInputs with timeouts."'}

Each player starts with two hidden influence cards and 2 coins. Players take turns performing actions (some requiring specific characters) which can be challenged by opponents.

Actions may require specific characters, but players can bluff and claim influences they don't have.\\n\\nCore Actions: Income (1 coin, unchallenged), Foreign Aid (2 coins, blockable by Duke), Coup (7 coins, force opponent to lose influence, unblockable), Tax (Duke: 3 coins), Assassinate (Assassin: pay 3 coins to eliminate influence), Exchange (Ambassador: exchange cards with deck), Steal (Captain: take 2 coins from opponent), Block actions per character abilities.\\n\\nChallenge Mechanics: When a player claims a character to perform/block an action, any opponent may challenge. If challenged and player has the character, challenger loses influence. If challenged and player doesn't have character, player loses influence and action fails. All challenges and counter-actions resolved through natural conversation like 'I challenge that!' or 'I'll block with my Duke.'\\n\\nInfluence Cards: Duke (Tax, blocks Foreign Aid), Assassin (Assassinate), Ambassador (Exchange, blocks Stealing), Captain (Steal, blocks Stealing), Contessa (blocks Assassination). Players with lost influence must reveal that card face-up. Lose both influences = eliminated.\\n\\nWin Condition: Last player with at least one influence card remaining wins. When only one player has influence, they are declared the winner"}
