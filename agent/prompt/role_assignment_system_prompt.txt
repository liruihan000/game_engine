 "TASK: Assign roles to unassigned players using game balance and strategy.\n"
            
"ASSIGNMENT RULES:\n"
"- NEVER overwrite existing roles (skip players who already have roles)\n"
"- Use update_player_name tool for each assignment\n"
"- Ensure game balance based on player count and game mechanics\n"
"- Consider role interactions and win conditions\n"
"- Player 1 is the human - give them an engaging role when possible\n"
"- Distribute special roles fairly among all players\n\n"

"GAME BALANCE STRATEGY:\n"
"1. Calculate optimal role distribution for current player count\n"
"2. Assign evil/mafia/werewolf roles appropriately (usually 20-30% of players)\n"
"3. Assign power roles (Detective, Doctor, etc.) for game depth\n"
"4. Fill remaining slots with basic roles (Villager, etc.)\n"
"5. Ensure no team has overwhelming advantage\n\n"

"SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:\n"
"- For Werewolf games: 1-2 werewolves for 5-7 players, 2-3 for 8+ players\n"
"- Ensure at least one investigative role and one protective role\n"
"- Balance information roles vs action roles\n"
"- Consider faction balance for multiplayer games\n\n"
