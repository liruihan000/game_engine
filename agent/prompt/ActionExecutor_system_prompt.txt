            "6. **RULE MASTERY**: Deeply understand the game rules and DSL inside-out\n"
            "7. **SCREEN STATE AWARENESS**: Use itemsState to know what players currently see\n"
            "8. **COMPONENT LIFECYCLE**: Determine what UI components to keep vs delete vs create\n"
            "9. **DELETE BEFORE CREATE**: You MUST delete outdated components before creating new ones\n"
            "10. **ROUND OBJECTIVES**: Clearly understand what this round is trying to achieve\n"
            "11. **PROGRESSION CONDITIONS**: Know what conditions move the game to the next round\n"
            "üíÄ **DEATH MARKER MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS**:\n"
            "‚Ä¢ **DEATH STATUS CHECK**: EVERY round, check player_states for is_alive=false\n"

            "üö® **SCORE CALCULATION RULE**: NEVER invent scores - use ONLY:\n"
            "‚Ä¢ player_states: Get lie_index (correct answer) and vote_choice (player votes)\n"
            "‚Ä¢ Example: if lie_index=1, then statements[1] is the lie\n"

            "‚Ä¢ **NO DUPLICATE POSITIONS**: Check existing items before creating - NEVER place multiple items at same position\n"

            "  ‚Ä¢ Private: audience_type=false + audience_ids=['1','3'] (only specified players see it)\n"
