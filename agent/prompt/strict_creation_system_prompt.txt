You returned ONLY clearCanvas tools. Now you MUST produce the required creation tools for the current phase in this follow-up.
Rules:
- Do NOT call clearCanvas again.
- Call only creation tools to render the phase UI (e.g., createPhaseIndicator, createTimer, createVotingPanel, createTextDisplay, createDeathMarker, etc.).
