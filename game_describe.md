    "title": "Two Truths and a Lie",
    "description": "A conversational party game where players take turns sharing three statements about themselves (two true, one false). Other players discuss and try to identify the lie through natural conversation and voting. Points awarded for correct guesses and successful deception.\n\nGame Flow Navigation: The game follows a speaker rotation system through phases - game_setup → round_start → statement_collection → discussion_phase → voting_phase → reveal_phase → scoring_update → (check if all players have been speaker) → round_start OR game_over. Each player takes one turn as the speaker per round. Multiple rounds can be played for longer games.\n\nConversation Mechanics: This game is purely conversational. Players share statements naturally like 'Here are my three things: First, I once met a celebrity. Second, I can speak four languages. Third, I've never broken a bone.' During discussion, players debate which seems false. Votes are extracted from conversation like 'I'm going with number two' or 'The language thing sounds made up.' No commands or structured inputs needed - the orchestrator interprets natural dialogue.\n\nWin Conditions: Game ends after all players have been speaker for the agreed number of rounds (default 1). Winner has highest total score from: correct lie identifications (1 point each) + fooling other players (1 point per player fooled when you're the speaker)"

    "title": "Coup",
    "description": "A bluffing and deduction game where players use character influences to gain coins and eliminate opponents. Each player starts with two hidden influence cards and 2 coins. Players take turns performing actions (some requiring specific characters) which can be challenged by opponents. Last player with influence wins.\n\nGame Flow Navigation: The game cycles through turns - game_setup → influence_distribution → turn_start → action_declaration → challenge_window → (if challenged: challenge_resolution) → counter_window → (if countered: counter_challenge_window) → action_resolution → influence_check → (check for winner) → turn_start OR game_over. Actions may require specific characters, but players can bluff and claim influences they don't have.\n\nCore Actions: Income (1 coin, unchallenged), Foreign Aid (2 coins, blockable by Duke), Coup (7 coins, force opponent to lose influence, unblockable), Tax (Duke: 3 coins), Assassinate (Assassin: pay 3 coins to eliminate influence), Exchange (Ambassador: exchange cards with deck), Steal (Captain: take 2 coins from opponent), Block actions per character abilities.\n\nChallenge Mechanics: When a player claims a character to perform/block an action, any opponent may challenge. If challenged and player has the character, challenger loses influence. If challenged and player doesn't have character, player loses influence and action fails. All challenges and counter-actions resolved through natural conversation like 'I challenge that!' or 'I'll block with my Duke.'\n\nInfluence Cards: Duke (Tax, blocks Foreign Aid), Assassin (Assassinate), Ambassador (Exchange, blocks Stealing), Captain (Steal, blocks Stealing), Contessa (blocks Assassination). Players with lost influence must reveal that card face-up. Lose both influences = eliminated.\n\nWin Condition: Last player with at least one influence card remaining wins. When only one player has influence, they are declared the winner"

    "title": "Bang!",
    "description": "A Wild West shootout card game where players have hidden roles and use playing cards to attack, defend, and survive. The Sheriff (revealed) must eliminate Outlaws and the Renegade. Deputies protect the Sheriff. Outlaws try to kill the Sheriff. The Renegade wants to be the last one standing. Players sit in a circle with distance determining who can be targeted by various cards.\n\nGame Flow Navigation: game_setup → role_assignment → character_assignment → initial_setup → turn_start → draw_phase → play_phase → (reaction windows for cards like Bang!/Missed!) → damage_resolution → discard_phase → elimination_check → (check win conditions) → turn_start OR game_over. Each turn consists of drawing 2 cards and playing cards from hand.\n\nRole Victory Conditions: Sheriff wins if all Outlaws and Renegade eliminated. Outlaws win if Sheriff eliminated (even if they're dead). Deputies win if Sheriff wins. Renegade wins if they're the last player alive. Sheriff is always revealed, other roles stay hidden until eliminated.\n\nDistance and Range: Players sit in a circle. Distance = shortest path between players (clockwise or counter-clockwise). Base range for Bang! is 1 (adjacent players only). Weapons increase Bang! range. Some cards (Panic!, Cat Balou) have fixed range 1. Distance affects strategic positioning and alliances.\n\nCard Types: Playing cards include Bang! (attack), Missed! (defense), Beer (heal), Panic!/Cat Balou (steal/discard), Duel (force showdown), Indians!/Gatling (area attacks), Weapons (increase range), and other equipment. Each character has unique abilities that modify rules (e.g., Rose Doolan sees everyone at distance -1).\n\nReaction System: When attacked with Bang!, target can play Missed! to avoid damage. Indians! requires all players to discard Bang! or take damage. Duel creates Bang! exchanges until someone can't respond. Real-time reaction windows use collectInputs with timeouts."

    "title": "Werewolf (Mafia)",
    "description": "Night phase allows secret actions by special roles. Werewolves choose elimination target, detective investigates, doctor protects. Actions resolve in order: kill attempt → protection check → investigation. Morning reveals results.\n\nGame Flow Navigation: The game follows a state graph - role_assignment → first_night → first_morning → first_day_discussion → first_day_voting → (night → morning → day_discussion → day_voting) cycle until win conditions met → game_over. Each phase has specific exit conditions that determine the next state. Check win conditions after eliminations: werewolves win if they equal/outnumber villagers, village wins if all werewolves eliminated"
